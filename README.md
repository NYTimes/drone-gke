# drone-gke

**This is currently very new and unstable.**

Please don't use it for anything important!

Drone plugin to deploy images to Kubernetes on Google Container Engine.
For the usage information and a listing of the available options please take a look at [the docs](DOCS.md).

This is a little simpler than deploying straight to Kube, because the api endpoints and credentials and whatnot can be derived using the Google credentials.
